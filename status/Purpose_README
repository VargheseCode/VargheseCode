I want to show how I initially organized my directory 
before transforming it in a way that Anas and I can both work using the same script 
because of the way that our directories are set up. I have to reconfigure the loading 
method 

This is how my directory is set up: 
Stim and Nostim files are separated and labeled by the subject name and ID
that way the files can just be read using just for loops and nothing else

Anas Directory Setup:
All files of a subject is one folder
that way access to all relevant files is easier 
He puts softcodes the loading variables 
Ex. 
        baseDir = 'C:\Users\alexv\Box\Lab work\Anas\'; % Set to where you stored the data
        subjectID = 'DLPFC023';
        subnum = 1;
        fname = 'lfp2';
        %% Load and preprocess ECOG data
        [INFO,ECOG_nostim,trials] = PreProcessECOG(subjectID,fname,baseDir);

        function [INFO,ECOG_data,trials,FileInfo] = PreProcessECOG(subjectID,fname,baseDir)

                  % Load INFO file and data files
                  INFO = LoadInfoFile; % Load INFO file from Box Drive
                  subjectPath = [baseDir subjectID '/'];
                  taskfile = dir([subjectPath fname '*taskdata.mat']);
                  S = load([subjectPath taskfile.name],'trials','restperiods');
                  trials = S.trials;
                  load([subjectPath fname '.mat'],'Data','FileInfo')
